What will make this AI intelligent ?

	A mix between randomness and natural selection

	Agents will be created both randomly (random code mutation) and through offsprings

	They will evolve in a environment that incentivize them to do something intelligible, 
	the final goal is that they learn a concept so that they are able to answer case that they never seen before

What is an agent ?
	
	The agents will be defined by an DNA (maybe be we could call this an Artificial. D. N., we'll see later) will be a string of code executed by either an emulator I have to make, 
	or something else, I would be happy if I could use self generated code like used in some malwares

	each agent will probably have to run on its own process, because they will crash most of the time
